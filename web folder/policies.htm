The effort of every true education should be to unlock that treasure."</div>
		<div id="main"><h1>Policies</h1><h2>Parent Conferences & Daily Reports</h2><p class="Shepherd">Conferences will be offered twice a year and will have a written assessment to cover your child's intellectual, physical, social, and emotional development. This is a good time to discuss any concerns or problems. You will receive a copy of the report with these areas of growth relating to your child. We will keep a copy for your child's records and we will need your signature stating that this conference was offered to you. Daily reports are given to parents of infants and toddlers about child's food intake, elimination, sleeping, and general behavior.</p><h2>Food & Other Allergy Information</h2><p class="Shepherd">Information about your child's food allergies will be posted by the eating area in your child's room. This information will be obtained from your child's enrollment forms. An Individualized Child Care Plan should be filled out regarding this in the area of allergies.</p><h2>Children's Records</h2><p class="Shepherd">I am required to have information on file regarding your child, including: a child enrollment form with the authorized release of pick-up persons, infant/toddler or child’s developmental history form, immunization records, health care summary signed and filled out by your health care source (updated annually under 24 months and when advanced to an older class), permission to administer over the counter products, a signed written consent to provide emergency medical or surgical care in case of not being able to reach a parent/guardian, travel & activity permission to transport and take neighborhood walks of no more than 4 blocks, parent policy agreement, and an emergency card. Also a permission request to have photos on our website, photos displayed of your child at daycare, and a Health Con-sultant release to view your child’s records. If you have an infant, an infant dietary feeding instruction form should be filled out for us to post in their room. Along with these items, if there are special circumstances regarding your child (asthma, allergies, eczema/dermatitis, seizures, or other) we would need an Individualized Child Care Plan on file. This information needs to be in the daycare on your child’s first day of attendance. Please inform us of any changes regarding this information as they occur. Information about your family is kept private except for the reporting I must do to my licensing worker. I am also required by Minnesota Law to report any suspected cases of child abuse or neglect to Social Services for investigation.</p><h2>Vacation and Illnesses</h2><p class="Shepherd">Due to the fact that a budget must be established and met for an entire week, your child will be allowed one week of vacation a year. This will be according to how many days your child is here in a week on a normal basis. This may be used in any way you wish and may include any sick days taken. We cannot refund tuition payments. The eight main holidays need to be paid if your child would normally attend that day unless taken as an allowed vacation day. Holidays are: New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day. Please let the office or your lead teacher know of a vacation time taken. Your vacation time is from the time of enrollment to the next year at the same time.</p><h2>Visitation</h2><p class="Shepherd">Parents of enrolled children are encouraged to visit the center at any time during the hours of operation.</p><h2>Field Trips</h2><p class="Shepherd">A “Travel and Activity Authorization” form should be signed and in each child’s file. This covers travel in a car, van, bus, or on public transportation for any reason. This form also includes walk permission. An occasional walk may be taken with children within a four block radius. This will normally be posted, but on occasion will not be. Field trips will be posted for parent information as they come up. Field trips will have an additional fee along with needing a signature giving permission for your child to participate. We follow the State licensing guidelines for field trips taken in daycare.</p><h2>Research & Public Relations Activity</h2><p class="Shepherd">A written permission will be obtained and kept in your child’s records in the event of an experimental research orpublic relations activity involving your child while at daycare. It would be obtained before each occasion oractivities will be summarized annually for your signed permission.</p><h2>Illnesses</h2><p class="Shepherd">If your child becomes ill while at daycare, you will be notified immediately. Your child will be kept comfortable in a supervised area until you arrive. In the event that your child is exposed to a contagious disease or condition, <u>a sign will be posted or a notice will be given to all parents of exposed children.</u> Parents must inform the daycare within 24 hours, when your child is diagnosed by a child’s source of medical or dental care of having a contagious reportable disease, lice, scabies, impetigo, ringworm, or chicken pox.<br>To be fair to all children, a sick child must be kept home or sent home if your child:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Has a reportable illness or condition determined to be contagious.</li>
		<li>Has chicken pox and is still contagious.</li>
		<li>Has vomited at the center since admission or has vomited that day or night before and is still sick.</li>
		<li>Has had three or more abnormal loose stools since admission or the night before.</li>
		<li>Has contagious conjunctivitis or pus draining from the eye.</li>
		<li>Has a bacterial infection such as strep throat or impetigo and has not completed 24 hours of antibiotics.</li>
		<li>Has unexplained lethargy.</li>
		<li>Has lice, ringworm, or scabies that is still contagious.</li>
		<li>Has 100+ degree temperature.</li>
		<li>Has an undiagnosed rash.</li>
		<li>Has significant respiratory distress.</li>
		<li>Cannot participate in program activities with reasonable comfort.</li>
		</ol><p>We ask and very much appreciate a phone call in the morning should your child not be attending for the day.</p>
		<h2>Napping Policies</h2><p class="Shepherd">A cot will be provided for toddler, pre-school, and kindergarten children (if needed). Children will have the opportunity to complete a nap or rest for 30 minutes or more. After 30 minutes, they will not be required to remain on their cot/crib and there will be a quiet activity available for them to participate in. Daycare will provide blankets and pillows with coverings for all children. Bedding for children will not be shared and will be washed weekly and as soiled or wet. Cribs are provided for the infants and have monthly inspections for crib safety and an annual product safety check. No pillows, heavy quilts, comforters, or pillow like stuffed toys, etc., will be placed in a crib with an infant. In accordance to Minnesota Statutes section 245A.1435, infants up to a year old will only be placed in their crib on their backs, unless the license holder has documentation from the infant’s parent and a Medical Doctor direct-ing an alternative sleeping position for the infant.</p><h2>Emergency/Accident & Injury Policies and Recordings</h2><p class="Shepherd">The daycare is very safety conscious, and has tried to eliminate all safety hazard. The staff does daily inspections of the center and outside play areas for potential hazards and unsafe situations. This is a constant and on-going concern and awareness that the staff is trained in to keep play areas safe. Our staff, on a daily basis, checks for children’s safety in avoiding:</p><h3>Injuries</h3><p class="shepherd">We make sure that the center is free of harmful or injurious equipment or situations. The staff eliminates broken toys and items that could pinch or cut. Scissors are kept under supervision and put out of reach when not being used. Staff supervises indoor and outdoor play areas and monitors activities along with directing in play time. Staff continually interacts with children to make sure activities and play are safe.</p><h3>Burns</h3><p class="Shepherd">We make sure there are no items available to the children that could potentially burn them. If ever anything is used creating a hot surface it is under total supervision by a staff person. The children are not allowed to use or play with anything with a hot surface.</p><h3>Poisoning</h3><p class="Shepherd">We make sure that the children have no access to any items that could cause poisoning. Cleaning products are kept out of the reach of children. Art and craft items are child safe. Outside play areas are kept free of poisonous products. Purses are kept under staff supervision and kept out of the reach of children.</p><h3>Choking</h3><p class="Shepherd">We make sure that items in each of the rooms are appropriate for the ages in the room and that there are not items available for the children in the infant and toddler rooms that could lead to choking. Toys are purchased with safety in mind, and are monitored during play to make sure they stay in good condition. Eating times are always under supervision and children are encouraged to chew their food well.</p><h3>Suffocation</h3><p class="Shepherd">We make sure that all items that could cause suffocation are not in the play areas of the children. Plastic bags and plastic type things are kept out of the reach of children. There are no enclosed areas that the children could play in or have access to.</p><h3>Traffic & Pedestrian</h3><p class="Shepherd">We make sure that play and travel (in car or on foot) are at the highest alert for safety of the children. We have fenced in play areas for children. We have incorporated a Safety Unit into our curricu-lum to help train the children in this area. Our staff is trained in keeping the children safe at all times.</p><p class="Shepherd">Although we try to stop accidents from happening. we realize that accidents and emergencies are always a possibility and are prepared for them. In such a case, these procedures will be followed:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Administer first aid if necessary. Staff has training in first aid and CPR. A first aid kit and manual will be on hand and in each room.</li>
		<li>Call proper emergency number if necessary:
			<ul>
			<li>Poison Control 1-800-222-1222</li>
			<li>Fire and Ambulance 911</li>
			<li>Mercy Hospital (763)236-6000 this is The Shepherds Inn Daycare’s hospital source for an emergency but we also may use an alternate hospital if <br>it is better equipped to respond to the emergency.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Call parent or other person specified on enrollment form for emergency. If child’s physician or dentist cannot be reached, we will call these clinics as follows:
			<ul>
			<li>Fairview Clinic or Riverway Clinic in Elk River and also an available dentistry in the Elk River area or the Smile Center in Big Lake.</li>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="Shepherd">All accidents, emergencies, injuries and incidents, except very minor ones will be recorded in the center’s accident report book and parents will be notified. Staff must fill out the report accurately and to the best of their knowledge answer all areas: Name of injured, age, date, incident, place of accident, type of injury, action taken, and to whom it was reported. Parents should sign in parent notification area. Staff will analyze this report book annually and discuss any modification needed for center’s policies based on the analysis.</p><h2>Pandemic Planning</h2><p class="Shepherd">Shepherds Inn Daycare will cooperate with state and local government disaster planning agencies working to prepare for or react to emergencies presented by a pandemic outbreak. (Laws of Minnesota 2007, chapter 112, section 6)</p><h2>Staff Qualifications</h2><p class="Shepherd">Our staff is qualified under Chapter 9503, Department Of Human Services, for child care centers. They are warm, loving, and fun. We look forward to working with you and your child and to providing the best care possible. It is our goal to create a pleasant, family-type atmosphere where your child can learn, be nurtured and grow. We have high standards in developing and maintaining a quality child care program. The children are supervised at all times. We have a Child Care Program Plan available for your review upon request.</p><h2>Video Entertainment</h2><p class="Shepherd">We are careful to only be watching movies that will help enforce positive attitudes and good morals. We do not allow violent movies or video games at daycare.</p><h2>Hand Washing</h2><p class="Shepherd">We use single service towels which are available for the children’s use along with drinking fountains or single use drinking cups.</p><h2>Fire and Tornado Drills</h2><p class="Shepherd">Drills will be exercised monthly. Staff is trained in fire prevention and fire evacuation of the children. Primary and secondary exits are posted in each room and rooms are inspected daily for potential hazards by staff. The fire drill meeting place is the large fenced-in playground. The tornado drill emergency shelter is in the pre-school room, staff is also trained in this area.</p><h2>Daycare Closings</h2><p class="Shepherd">Due to winter storms, if the Elk River Schools are closed before 6:00a.m., The Shepherds Inn Daycare will also be closed. Listen to WCCO radio for information. If schools don’t close or are two hours late, we will be open. If schools close early during the day, due to winter storms, we will stay open until all the children have been safely picked up.</p><h2>Insurance</h2><p class="Shepherd">I have liability insurance on the children in the amount of $1,000,000. A policy is available for review upon request.</p><h2>Internal Review</h2><p class="Shepherd">If the facility has reason to believe that an internal or external report of alleged or suspected maltreatment has been made, the facility must complete an internal review and take corrective action, to protect the health and safety of the children in care. The internal review must include an evaluation of policies and procedures to see if they were adequate and followed. If a need for additional staff training is needed, due to the event being similar to past events, or if there is a need for a corrective action by the license holder to protect the health and safety of the children in care, the procedure guidelines will be followed. The internal review will be completed by Julie Goldenman (owner), or if this individual is involved in the alleged or suspected maltreatment, then Rachel Bursche (Assistant Director/Pre-School Staff) will be responsible for completing the internal review.</p><h2>Grievance Procedure</h2><p class="Shepherd">If you are dissatisfied with the service we are providing for you and your child, please address and communicate any problems or concerns you may have directly to Julie Goldenman, the owner.</p></div>
